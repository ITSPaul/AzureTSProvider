{"name":"Azuretsprovider","tagline":"Azure Table Storage Provider","body":"Azure Table Storage gives a great low cost alternative to SQL (Provided you don't need relational data*).\r\nHowever you usually have to decorate your model classes to specifically use it, and most examples only real deal with one or two models, and these are quite explicitly built.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this project to to build a robust provider that will allow you to completely abstract away the need to create Azure dependencies on your code. Thus, you can simply provide a set of model classes and some basic Azure info (such as your secret key etc) - and this provider will handle all the persistence on your behalf.\r\n\r\nWe will also explore the possibility of using 'semi-relational' data - in that we can store and query on complex objects like you can in MongoDB etc.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
